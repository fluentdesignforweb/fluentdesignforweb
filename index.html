        <meta name="Description" content="Think for a moment that, what would happen if you combine the Metro UI, with Material Design, the result is Fluent Design also called Fabric UI. Fluent Design is the design which is used by Windows 10 and other UWP apps. But why should it be limited to UWP apps only, why can't we use the same for websites. That's why, we have come up with this project, where we aim to recreate the Fluent Design for web. We are still in development but you can download Fluent Design For Web from the button provided below, and learn how to use it in development using the given link.">
